Session rules for AI agents working this site repo.

## Concurrent sessions

Site repos generally get **one** agent session at a time — but central
fleet-maintenance sessions (reddoor-maintenance) also open PRs here, so:

- **Check for an existing fix before starting one.** Look for fresh `fix/*`
  branches and open or just-merged PRs addressing the same signal — a fleet
  session may already have been dispatched for it. A duplicate fix gets
  closed as superseded, never merged.
- **Re-verify after any pause.** After a session-limit pause, compaction, or
  long gap: `git log --oneline -3` and `git status` before committing, and
  re-confirm the PR head SHA before merging.
- **If sessions must run concurrently** (rare), each works in its own git
  worktree — never commit from a checkout another session may be using.
